Version: 0.1.1.9001
Authors@R: c(person("Michael D.","Sumner", role = c("aut", "cre"), email = "mdsumner@gmail.com"),

Description: Methods for dplyr verbs for sp Spatial classes. The basic verbs that modify data attributes, remove or re-arrange rows are supported and provide complete Spatial analogs of the input data. The group_by and summarize chain returns a non-topological union. There is limited support for joins, with left and inner to copy attributes from another table.
